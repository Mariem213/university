                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
                <p>The Global Student Satisfaction Awards are the only student-powered global university overview capturing feedback on life inside and outside the classroom. Hosted every two years by our partners, Studyportals, the Awards have become a
                    staple in showcasing some of the world’s best performing universities and colleges in select areas. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The review-based Global Student Satisfaction Awards recognise the universities that have achieved the highest student satisfaction ratings. The reviews are collected by Studyportal’s community and partner study associations, like U-Multirank
                    and include checks to ensure the validity of the reviews. In the reviews, students can rate their study experience on a scale from 1 (lowest rating) to 5 (highest rating) by answering the following questions to assess their satisfaction
                    in the respective eight categories – two of which are new this year: </p>
                <br>
                <p> 1. Overall satisfaction (‘How would you rate your overall study experience?’) <br> 2. Admission process (‘How simple was it to apply to your programme? Was the information that you found on the website clear enough? Did you get support
                    from the university staff?’) <br> 3. Student-teacher interaction (‘How helpful, engaged and interested were your teachers with you? How easy was it for you to interact with them, during or after class?’) <br> 4. Online classroom experience
                    (NEW) (‘How well did your university change education to online? (e.g. format, content, interaction, quality of online classes)’)<br> 5. Covid-19 crisis management (NEW) (‘How do you rate your university’s response to the Covid-19
                    crisis? How well did they support you and your fellow students during the pandemic?’)<br> 6. Student diversity (‘How diverse/friendly was the atmosphere at your university (E.g. different countries, cultures, religions, age, gender,
                    special needs, etc.)?’)<br> 7. Quality of student life (‘How was your everyday life? Especially when thinking about the city where you lived, did it satisfy your needs and expectations?’)<br> 8. Career development (‘Did the university
                    provide support for your career development (E.g. extracurricular courses, workshops and conferences, help in finding internships)?’)</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Awards were led by Studyportals CEO and co-Founder, Edwin van Rest at their global headquarters in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The ceremony included testimonials and insights from the report, thought leadership from distinguished keynote
                    speakers and input from partners on the eight award categories. For example, our very own U-Multirank project leader, Dr. Frans van Vught presented the award for ‘Covid-19 crisis management’. Each category included three regional winners/
                    nominees and one global winner. The three regions included, the Americas (North and South Amrica), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), and APAC (Asia Pacific). </p>
